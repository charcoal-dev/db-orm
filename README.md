# Charcoal Database ORM

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

The DB ORM library adds an object-relational mapping layer to Charcoalâ€™s database system, letting developers interact
with tables through typed entities instead of raw SQL. It integrates with the kernel lifecycle, supports events for
persistence actions, and offers a clean API for querying, saving, and managing records while keeping database logic
organized and consistent across projects.
